***Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
    - The purpose of the election audit analysis at the end is to help seth and tom understand the main analysis key points of the data set they acquired, understanding the largest county data,
    number of votes, which election official had the highest amount of votes and won which county for a certain percentage to analyze popularity and ultimately help make key decision making factors. 

***Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

***Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
    - The script can be used for future elections for even a bigger data set for different, counties, cities, states or for the country overall. We can look at regional data and state data overall to determine winners in different counties and ultimately elect officials properly with this set of data that can executed in such a short amount of time. Another way this script can be modified in the future is to look at different party breakdowns or use this for different elections like senate, governer, mayor and etc. 
    


Conclusion: 

- overall this code was easily understandable and was able to execute, unfortunately I did come across a bug with teh main code given, so when I run the code, the winner isn't outputted. The rest correctly works
